What code draws the blades of grass?  line(x, height-10, x + random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h)); }
  
  What code makes the "lawnmower" come by?  if (random() > 0.999) 
How often does it come by? 99.9% the random number will be too small to cut the grass.

What's the point of the h variable?
the h variable is the height of the blade of grass and continues to grow by 3 each row

What do the three numerical arguments of colorMode do?

What does the -10 do in the second and fourth arguments of the line function, height-10-random(h)? Why is it there?
h-10 is there to show where the grass blade should begin on the canvas. 10 is the height od the brown rectangle so we want the grass to begins so it looks like its coming out of the dirt.
